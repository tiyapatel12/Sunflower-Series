            <p id="s3">This was the first painting in the series to be signed, and the rest followed the same design of having
                Van Goghâ€™s name painted on the left of the vase. It was painted in Arles, France in August 1888 and
                features twelve sunflowers, which is a drastic change in flowers than the first two paintings. It
                currently resides at the Neue Pinakothek in Munich, Germany.</p>
