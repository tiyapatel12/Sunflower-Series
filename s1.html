            <p class="s1">The first painting was created in 1888 and features three sunflowers, the smallest amount in the series.
                It currently is hidden away in a private collection but was last displayed in Cleveland art gallery.
                This was in 1984 and it was only shown for a month before disappearing from the public eye. This
                painting was not published in colour until 1980, resulting in it being hardly known other than by
                specialists. Interestingly, after Van Gogh died it was one of the first of his paintings to be sold.
                This happened in 1891 for Â£24.</p>
