            <p1>The final painting of the series was painted in January 1889 and is another copy of sunflower 4 and 6. It is currently in Sompo Museum of Art in Tokyo on permanent display. It was brought in 1987 for 5.3 billion yen which was the highest price paid for a single painting at the time. Once the painting was acquired by the museum, annual attendance increased 8 times than the previous year.</p1>
