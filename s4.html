            <p1>This painting is probably the most famous in the series and definitely the most associated with the
                series. It is a collection of fifteen flowers and was painted in August 1888, also in Arles. Vincentâ€™s
                roommate for a while, Gauguin, particularly admired these flowers. It is now displayed in the London
                National Gallery and in 2022, two just stop oil activists thew soup on it and glued themselves below it
                in protest.</p1>
