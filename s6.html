                Painted in January 1889, Van Gogh painted this after he was released from the hospital after the famous
                ‘ear cutting’ incident and was painted a lot more vividly than the original in terms of brush strokes
                and colour. It is rumoured that Van Gogh cut off his ear as a result of an argument he had with his
                friend Gauguin. </p>
