            <p1>Similarly, to the last, this painting is also a copy, but is a copy of sunflower 4 rather than 3. Painted in January 1889, Van Gogh painted this after he was released from the hospital after the famous ‘ear cutting’ incident and was painted a lot more vividly than the original in terms of brush strokes and colour. It is rumoured that Van Gogh cut off his ear as a result of an argument he had with his friend Gauguin. </p1>
