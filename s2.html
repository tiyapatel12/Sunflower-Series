            <p class="s2">This painting featured six sunflowers and was the second in the series. Painted in 1888, it was the
                first to be brought by a Japanese collector. This is notable due to Van Gogh’s interest in Japanese art
                and has his own series of work inspired by the culture. The painting was brought in 1920 by Koyata
                Yamamoto, who paid the equivalent of £3200. Sadly, it was destroyed 6 August 1945 due to the Hiroshima
                atomic bomb. Due to this, it is also hardly known other than by specialists.</p>
