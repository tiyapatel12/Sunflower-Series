            <p1>This painting is almost identical to sunflower 3. Van Gogh decided to copy his own work in order to decorate the walls of the yellow house, the studio that he set up in Arles to live in with Gauguin. It was painted in Munich, Germany in November- December 1888 and currently is displayed in the Philadelphia Museum of Art.</p1>
